QUESTION ONE
What is software engeneering - it refers to systematic application of engeneering principles, methods, tools to the development and maintenance of a high quality software. It involves development, design, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
It differs from the traditional as based on the following:
1.Scope: Software engineering encompasses the full software development lifecycle, whereas traditional programming focusses on code.
2.Processes: To assure quality and efficiency, software engineers use structured processes and techniques such as requirement gathering, design, testing, and maintenance.
3.Team Collaboration: Software engineering frequently necessitates cooperation and collaboration, with varied responsibilities such as designers, testers, and project managers.

QUESTION TWO
The following are the processes based on the software development life cycle:
1.Preliminary Investigation - it is based on  brief investigation of a system unde consideration and give a clear picture of system in use
2.Feasibility Study - its based on testing a proposed system to establish its workability, meeting user requirements, effectuve use of resources.
3.Detailed System Study: its based proccess that is carrried out with the objectives of a proposed system.
4. System Analysis - process of collecting factual data, understanding the process involved, identifying problems and recommend feasible suggestions for improving system functioning.
5.System Design - It is based of the process of transforming the requirements SRS to a design suitable for implementation in programming
6.Coding - Process where the system design is implemented to a workable system
7.Testing - its based on a process of executing a program with intent of finding an error.
8.Implementation - Stage where theory of the project is turned into practice.
